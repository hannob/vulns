FAQ
===

What?
-----

I'm wondering how many of the "famous" security vulnerabilities have actually been used in attacks that
have been documented, so I made a list.

Couldn't there be unknown attacks?
----------------------------------

Obviously this list can only cover attacks that have been publicly documented, particularly targetted
attacks or attacks within communities with low transparency.

Still if attacks have been widely used it's reasonable to assume that someone will have documented them.

The table is wrong! Attack X has been used!
-------------------------------------------

Please open an issue or a pull request. I created this repo to learn whether my assumptions are correct.

What counts as a real world attack?
-----------------------------------

I realize the distinction can be blurry, but it should be an attack that has been carried out without
the consent of the owner of the affected system and it should've successfully compromised some security
expectation.

Also there should be at least one publicly available description with sufficient detail to make the attack
plausible, not just vague rumors.

There's an important attack missing!
------------------------------------

Open an issue or a pull request, but I may close it if I believe the attack hasn't received sufficient
attention or is a pure marketing stunt.

There's a logo missing!
-----------------------
